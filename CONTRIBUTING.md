# Contributing

## Git conventions

- Pull Requests are merged using "Squash and merge".
- Pull Requests that are not in draft should have a title that follows
  [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Keep your Pull Requests as atomic as possible. They should leave the system
  in a working state.


## Requirements

- go 1.19+
- make
- docker (used to regenerate protobufs)


## Run locally

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.qredo.com:qrdochain/fusionchain.git
```


### Run the chain

The `application` directory contains the Cosmos SDK blockchain code. We can run
a local node with the following:

```bash
cd application
./init.sh
```

This will run a local node with a couple of pre-funded accounts.


### Run the mocked keyring

In a separate terminal, run the mocked keyring (`mokr`):

```bash
go run ./cmd/mmpc
```

`mokr` will automatically monitor the chain and generate new keys and
signatures when requested.


### Make transactions

To interact with the chain you can use the `fusiond` CLI tool.

It's suggested to create an alias like this:

```
alias fchain="fusiond --node tcp://localhost:27657 --home ~/.fusiond/ --from shulgin --gas-prices 1000000000nQRDO"
```

that includes some common flags:

- `--node tcp://localhost:27657`, the Tendermint RPC endpoint
- `--home ~/.fusiond/`, the directory containing keys data
- `--from shulgin`, the account being used to sign transactions
- `--gas-prices 1000000000nQRDO`, the fee for transactions

Some sample transactions to run:

```bash
# create a new workspace
fchain tx identity new-workspace --yes

# create a new key
fchain tx treasury new-key-request 0 ecdsa --yes

# wait for the MPC to pick up the request and generate a new key
# you can monitor all the requests with:
fchain q treasury key-requests all

# and after the request in fulfilled you will find the public key:
fchain q treasury keys

# let's use your new key to sign a payload
fchain tx treasury new-signature-request 0 'aabbccddeeff' --yes

# after a while you'll be able to retrieve the signature generated by the MPC
fchain q treasury signature-requests all

# you can create a Ethereum-specific wallet using your public key
fchain tx treasury new-wallet-request ethereum 0 --yes

# retrieving the wallets will include the Ethereum address for that key:
fchain q treasury wallets
```


### Run the web UI

Instead of running queries in the CLI, it might be easier to use a GUI.

The Web UI is a React app bundled with Vite. You can run it locally with:

```
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

The output will include a link to open it in your browser.

Providing a full-fledged front-end is out of scope, the web UI is intended to
be useful as a monitoring and debugging tool during development.


## Regenerating protobufs

If you modify any of the `.proto` files, you'll need to regenerate the
Go definitions. You can do this with:

```
cd application
make proto-all
```
